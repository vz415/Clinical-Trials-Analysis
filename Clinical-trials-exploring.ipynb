    "# Clinical Trials Database Analysis\n",
    "Clinical trials help to introduce new medical techniques, drugs, and medical devices, as well as observe their efficacy. This database can provide insights into medical trends, research by drug and medical device companies, and the activities of hospitals and research centers. There is already a [great study](http://www.alltrials.net/), and [visual](https://trialstracker.ebmdatalab.net/#/) of this database from a group in the UK who wanted to know which research groups were not sharing the results of their studies. This investigation has begun an effort to promote more transparency and accountability of sharing the results of clinical trials, rather than skew results to benefit corporations.\n",
    "\n",
    "My focus will be on assessing trends of research within the clinical trials database, beginning with an assessment of the types of studies and eventually assessing temporal trends in the types of studies. However, this study is not only motivated out of curiosity. As a biomedical engineer who has participated in entrepreneurial competitions, one of the first questions investors and advisors ask is \"have you checked for similar studies and results in the clinicaltrials.gov database?\" This is also an attempt to streamline this process for both myself, and other researchers who are assessing the landscape for commercialization, hoepfully saving time along the way.\n",

    "Observational study designs, also called epidemiologic study designs, are often retrospective and are used to assess potential causation in exposure-outcome relationships and therefore influence preventive methods. Observational study designs include ecological designs, cross sectional, case-control, case-crossover, retrospective and prospective cohorts. An important subset of observational studies is diagnostic study designs, which evaluate the accuracy of diagnostic procedures and tests as compared to other diagnostic measures. These include diagnostic accuracy designs, diagnostic cohort designs, and diagnostic randomized controlled trials.\n",
    "\n",
    "Interventional studies are often prospective and are specifically tailored to evaluate direct impacts of treatment or preventive measures on disease. Each study design has specific outcome measures that rely on the type and quality of data utilized. Additionally, each study design has potential limitations that are more severe and need to be addressed in the design phase of the study. This manuscript is meant to provide an overview of study design types, strengths and weaknesses of common observational and interventional study designs.\n",
